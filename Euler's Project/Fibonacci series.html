Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:

1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...

By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.

Solution : 

$previous = 1;
$actual = 0;
$next = 2;
$sum_of_even = 0;


for($i = 0 ; $i<30; $i++){
    $actual = $previous + $next;
    
    if(($actual % 2) == 0){
        $sum_of_even = $actual + $sum_of_even;
    }

    $previous = $next;
    $next = $actual;

}
echo $actual . "\n";
echo $sum_of_even;
